# weather-app
Make the frontend structure as wanted by using div and styles

Use useState hook to set value of input search(default is set to Delhi)

use useEffect hook to run getweatherInfo() only once on refresh

To get data of api, make an async await - these are used to make our code async and to implement promises

Promise is either we get the data or we get the error(try, catch)

we have to pass same location in url which user searched for(paste the api call)

Then we can inspect and chk console, we get data for that particular city

our api has many info in the form of array of objects, so destructure them
